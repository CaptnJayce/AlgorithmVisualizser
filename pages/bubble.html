			<h2 class = "text">how does it work:</h2>
			<p class = "text">
				> Bubble sort works by iterating over an input list element by element. eg: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]<br> 
				> with each iteration it checks if the current element is greater or lesser than the next<br>
				â†³ if its greater then it swaps, otherwise it does nothing. 
			</p>

			<h2 class = "text">use cases:</h2>
			<p class = "text">
				> good for small data sets<br>
				> as a teaching tool<br>
				> isnt used much as it gets outshined by other sorting algorithms
			</p>
			
			<h2 class = "text">code:</h2>
			<p class = "text">
				the code is as follows (continues iterating and swapping until swapped is false):
